133 Behold, how good and pleasant it is    when brothers dwell in unity!2 It is like the precious oil on the head,    running down on the beard,on the beard of Aaron,    running down on the collar of his robes!3 It is like the dew of Hermon,    which falls on the mountains of Zion!For there the Lord has commanded the blessing,    life forevermore.
