14 The fool says in his heart, “There is no God.”    They are corrupt, they do abominable deeds;    there is none who does good.
2 The Lord looks down from heaven on the children of man,    to see if there are any who understand,    who seek after God.
3 They have all turned aside; together they have become corrupt;    there is none who does good,    not even one.
4 Have they no knowledge, all the evildoers    who eat up my people as they eat bread    and do not call upon the Lord?
5 There they are in great terror,    for God is with the generation of the righteous.6 You would shame the plans of the poor,    but the Lord is his refuge.
7 Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion!    When the Lord restores the fortunes of his people,    let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad.
