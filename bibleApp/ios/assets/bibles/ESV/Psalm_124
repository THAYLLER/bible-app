124 If it had not been the Lord who was on our side—    let Israel now say—2 if it had not been the Lord who was on our side    when people rose up against us,3 then they would have swallowed us up alive,    when their anger was kindled against us;4 then the flood would have swept us away,    the torrent would have gone over us;5 then over us would have gone    the raging waters.
6 Blessed be the Lord,    who has not given us    as prey to their teeth!7 We have escaped like a bird    from the snare of the fowlers;the snare is broken,    and we have escaped!
8 Our help is in the name of the Lord,    who made heaven and earth.
