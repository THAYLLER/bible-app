100 Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth!2     Serve the Lord with gladness!    Come into his presence with singing!
3 Know that the Lord, he is God!    It is he who made us, and we are his;    we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
4 Enter his gates with thanksgiving,    and his courts with praise!    Give thanks to him; bless his name!
5 For the Lord is good;    his steadfast love endures forever,    and his faithfulness to all generations.
