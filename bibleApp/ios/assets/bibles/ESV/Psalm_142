142 With my voice I cry out to the Lord;    with my voice I plead for mercy to the Lord.2 I pour out my complaint before him;    I tell my trouble before him.
3 When my spirit faints within me,    you know my way!In the path where I walk    they have hidden a trap for me.4 Look to the right and see:    there is none who takes notice of me;no refuge remains to me;    no one cares for my soul.
5 I cry to you, O Lord;    I say, “You are my refuge,    my portion in the land of the living.”6 Attend to my cry,    for I am brought very low!Deliver me from my persecutors,    for they are too strong for me!7 Bring me out of prison,    that I may give thanks to your name!The righteous will surround me,    for you will deal bountifully with me.
