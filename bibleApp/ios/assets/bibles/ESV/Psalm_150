150 Praise the Lord!Praise God in his sanctuary;    praise him in his mighty heavens!2 Praise him for his mighty deeds;    praise him according to his excellent greatness!
3 Praise him with trumpet sound;    praise him with lute and harp!4 Praise him with tambourine and dance;    praise him with strings and pipe!5 Praise him with sounding cymbals;    praise him with loud clashing cymbals!6 Let everything that has breath praise the Lord!Praise the Lord!
