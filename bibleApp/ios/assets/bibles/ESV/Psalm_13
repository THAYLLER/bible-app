13 How long, O Lord? Will you forget me forever?    How long will you hide your face from me?2 How long must I take counsel in my soul    and have sorrow in my heart all the day?How long shall my enemy be exalted over me?
3 Consider and answer me, O Lord my God;    light up my eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death,4 lest my enemy say, “I have prevailed over him,”    lest my foes rejoice because I am shaken.
5 But I have trusted in your steadfast love;    my heart shall rejoice in your salvation.6 I will sing to the Lord,    because he has dealt bountifully with me.
