87 On the holy mount stands the city he founded;2     the Lord loves the gates of Zion    more than all the dwelling places of Jacob.3 Glorious things of you are spoken,    O city of God. Selah
4 Among those who know me I mention Rahab and Babylon;    behold, Philistia and Tyre, with Cush—    “This one was born there,” they say.5 And of Zion it shall be said,    “This one and that one were born in her”;    for the Most High himself will establish her.6 The Lord records as he registers the peoples,    “This one was born there.” Selah
7 Singers and dancers alike say,    “All my springs are in you.”
