70 Make haste, O God, to deliver me!    O Lord, make haste to help me!2 Let them be put to shame and confusion    who seek my life!Let them be turned back and brought to dishonor    who delight in my hurt!3 Let them turn back because of their shame    who say, “Aha, Aha!”
4 May all who seek you    rejoice and be glad in you!May those who love your salvation    say evermore, “God is great!”5 But I am poor and needy;    hasten to me, O God!You are my help and my deliverer;    O Lord, do not delay!
