12 Save, O Lord, for the godly one is gone;    for the faithful have vanished from among the children of man.2 Everyone utters lies to his neighbor;    with flattering lips and a double heart they speak.
3 May the Lord cut off all flattering lips,    the tongue that makes great boasts,4 those who say, “With our tongue we will prevail,    our lips are with us; who is master over us?”
5 “Because the poor are plundered, because the needy groan,    I will now arise,” says the Lord;    “I will place him in the safety for which he longs.”6 The words of the Lord are pure words,    like silver refined in a furnace on the ground,    purified seven times.
7 You, O Lord, will keep them;    you will guard us from this generation forever.8 On every side the wicked prowl,    as vileness is exalted among the children of man.
