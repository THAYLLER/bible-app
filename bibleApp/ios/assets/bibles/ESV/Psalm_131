131 O Lord, my heart is not lifted up;    my eyes are not raised too high;I do not occupy myself with things    too great and too marvelous for me.2 But I have calmed and quieted my soul,    like a weaned child with its mother;    like a weaned child is my soul within me.
3 O Israel, hope in the Lord    from this time forth and forevermore.
